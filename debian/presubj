Gathering information relevant to mdadm as root
===============================================

If you are not reporting bugs as root (which you should not), you will be
prompted to give permission to run a script to collect relevant information
from your system as the root user. Only the root user has access to some
information that might be relevant to the bug report you are about to file.


** Please give permission to run the script as root when asked momentarily.


If you would rather obtain the same information manually, you can run
  /usr/share/bug/mdadm/script 3>&1
as root and include or attach the output.
