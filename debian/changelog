mdadm (2.5.3.git200610100838-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merged upstream changes:
    - --examine now reports chunk size also for RAID6 and RAID10
    - fix endianness issues with v1 superblocks (closes: #385726) and bitmap
      metadata.
    - improved message when mdadm detects similar superblocks
      (closes: #385951).
    - Documents that the automatic update of the super-minor field in the
      superblock when using a 2.6 kernel only applies to RAID levels 1 and
      higher. RAID0 array superblocks must be manually updated
      (closes: #386315, #388172).
  * Removed patch previously used to fix #385951 because it's not adequate.
    See the bug log for reasons.

mdadm (2.5.3.git200608202239-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * This revision is dedicated to Peter Samuelson for his RAID10 expertise^W
    educated guess^W^W pure luck. (:
  * Now writes minimal mdadm.conf file even if the MD subsystem has not been
    loaded and the scan for arrays thus failed.
  * Now tries to ensure that the configuration file used for the initramfs
    actually defines arrays.
  * Now preserves MAILADDR from an existing mdadm.conf when generating a new
    one.
  * Documentation updates.
  * Updated debconf translations:
    - German by Mario Joußen.
    - Vietnamese by Clytie Siddall (closes: #390311).
    - Dutch by Frans Pop (closes: #390955).
    - French by Jean-Luc Coulon (closes: #391215).

mdadm (2.5.3.git200608202239-7) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fixed a serious bug in the debconf script which would cause the
    configuration to exit prematurely in cases when the root could not be
    determined. Since this is RC, the urgency is set to medium.
  * Updated the documentation a bit.
  * Updated debconf translations:
    - Swedish by Daniel Nylander (closes: #389040).
    - Czech by Miroslav Kure (closes: #389083).
    - Russian by Yuri Kozlov (closes: #389086).
    - Brazilian Portuguese by Felipe Augusto.

mdadm (2.5.3.git200608202239-6) unstable; urgency=high

  * Bumping urgency to high because previous version has been in unstable for
    three days and this one really only fixes a stupid segfault:
  * Reworked the parsing of /proc/partitions and spotted a mean segfault
    (closes: #388355).

mdadm (2.5.3.git200608202239-5) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Keeping medium urgency due to RC bug.
  * Modified the patch responsible for pruning parent devices so that
    superblocks at the end of a disk do not get interpreted twice. It now
    makes less assumptions about the exact output of /proc/partitions and
    should thus be more robust (now closes: #385951).
  * Added code that defers mdadm preconfiguration when the debconf backend is
    too old (and does not provide debconf-escape). Now configuration is
    postponed until the postinst is run in this case.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Thu, 14 Sep 2006 11:16:39 +0200

mdadm (2.5.3.git200608202239-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Correct error related to an unbound variable in postinst.
  * Keeping medium urgency.

mdadm (2.5.3.git200608202239-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Urgency medium because of RC bugs.
  * Add versioned dependency to debconf (closes: #385994); temporary fix until
    we find a proper fix for #386439.
  * Add patch by Steinar H. Gunderson to ensure mdadm does not interpret
    a superblock as belonging to a device when it's actually part of
    a partition on that device (closes: #385951).
  * Do not override the superblock default version in mdadm.conf to prevent
    creation of superblocks that the kernel can't handle (closes: #384614).
  * Added a note to alert people that the warning about arrays not listed in
    the configuration file is only relevant if the arrays are needed to be
    brought up by mdadm from initramfs during boot (closes: #385017).
  * Added bootloader/cmdline info to bugscript so that future bug reports via
    bug/reportbug include information on how the system is booted with respect
    to RAID (the root partition).
  * If mdadm is being configured in a chroot, it now defaults to starting all
    arrays from the initial ramdisk, rather than trying to figure out the root
    MD array (we're using /proc information, so it would be the one of the
    host, not the one of the chroot) (closes: #386468).
  * Added LSB headers to init scripts.
  * Reworked the documentation with respect to the use of "MD" and "RAID", and
    added a FAQ entry on the meaning of "MD". Thanks to Frans Pop for his
    help!
  * Updated debconf translations:
    - Czech by Miroslav Kure (closes: #384754).
    - French by Florentin Duneau (closes: #385690).
    - Russian by Yuri Kozlov (closes: #387017).

mdadm (2.5.3.git200608202239-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Allow ARRAY lines in configuration file to break across lines
    (closes: #384222).
  * Improved initramfs hook; now does not rely on initramfs to provide RAID
    assembly:
    - if a checked mdadm.conf file is present, use that.
    - if an unchecked mdadm.conf is present, create a temporary one
      - if that fails, use the unchecked one iff it contains at least one
        ARRAY statement. Otherwise rely on auto-generation from the initramfs
        during the book (and hope for the best).
    - if no mdadm.conf is found, create one on the fly
      - if that fails, hope that the auto-generation will work during boot
  * Improved the messages printed by the initramfs script.
  * Do not store the debconf answer for whether arrays not listed in the
    configuration file should be used.
  * Now asks again for the devices to start (preseeded with 'all') if the user
    does not want to proceed with devices not listed in the configuration
    file.

mdadm (2.5.3.git200608202239-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Tracking upstream git releases.
    - now the --run switch behaves as stated in the manpage. This properly
      fixes #287415
    - new version-1 partitionable arrays are now named X instead of _dX (e.g.
      0 instead of _d0) for device names like md_dX. I actually think this is
      a bug and hope upstream will use dX (e.g. d0) instead in a future
      version.
    - we specify --symlink=no and thus disable the new feature to create
      /dev/mdX symlinks to /dev/md/X devices until the entire device node mess
      is cleared up. No need to introduce yet another complicating factor at
      this stage.
  * Instead of trying to do a whole lot of magic with respect to detecting
    RAID devices to start, mdadm from now on requires a valid mdadm.conf file
    to be installed. It still tries to do what it can, but there are no
    heuristics anymore. See /usr/share/doc/mdadm/README.upgrading-2.5.3 .
  * Removed the zero-superblock warning because we require the user to sign
    off the configuration file anyway.
  * This also enables us to use mdadm.conf from the initial ramdisk and thus
    closes: #381303.
  * In case the user chooses to assemble all arrays from the initial ramdisk,
    use the new homehost feature of mdadm (closes: #381057). This will start
    only those arrays belonging to the local system, unless it is the first
    run on a system, in which case it will start all arrays and mark them as
    belonging to the local system.
  * Improved the debconf control script: integrated error messages into the
    frontends, and made it a bit smarter. Error messages can now be
    translated, and the script checks whether the user's choice is listed in
    the configuration file and only proceeds if it is, or the user chooses to
    ignore that it is not.
  * mkconf can now take a generate/force-generate parameter to write directly
    to /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf. A second parameter specifies an alternate
    filename.
  * mkconf now outputs comments for the settings it suggests.
  * Removed all udev-related stuff. We must coexist with udev because there
    are setups that assemble arrays without mdadm, so the device nodes must be
    created by udev, if that is used.
    (closes: #382263, #382450, #383688, #383891, #383806, #382480)
    Staying at low urgency since these (RC) bugs only exist in unstable.
  * Now installs MD modules and mdadm/mdrun into initial ramdisk regardless of
    whether the hook script thinks there are devices to start. This was done
    to enable recovery from the initramfs shell.
  * Now uses 'MD' instead of 'RAID' consistently in all messages.
  * Now rebuilds initramfs for all installed kernels.
  * Now breaks the endless config loop only when the user does not see the
    question (see #381284, #381007).
  * Don't fail mdadm-raid when /dev is on a read-only filesystem
    (closes: #382876).
  * Updated debconf translations:
    - French by Florentin Duneau (closes: #382389).

mdadm (2.5.2-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Applied patch by upstream to fix the logic of the --run switch (see
    #287415). Thus also reverted the mdadm-raid hack used to fix the bug in
    the 2.5.2-9 upload.
  * Recognise devfs-style device nodes by fixing a regression bug in the root
    RAID autodetection code (closes: #381007), which was introduced as part of
    the fix for #380596 in the 2.5.2-9 upload. The bug is RC, but it only
    applies to unstable right now, so I am not pumping up the urgency.
    The autodetection code now doesn't care about the actual name of the array
    device, but instead only insists that it exists, is a block device, and
    recognised as an array by mdadm (mdadm --detail).
  * Added safety net to prevent endless loops in RAID autodetection. Now just
    falls back to starting all arrays from the initramfs if it fails to
    determine an acceptable array for the / filesystem in three tries
    (closes: #381284, also see #381007).
  * Added udev rules file to prevent udev from ever creating md device nodes,
    which can get in the way of mdadm (also see next item).
  * Added a workaround to the initramfs hook to deal with the problem with
    /dev/md/X device nodes when /dev/mdX is also present and version-0
    superblocks are in use (closes: #381181).
  * checkarray: correctly recognise when the kernel is too old for parity
    checks, or when there are no redundant arrays present (closes: #380746).
  * checkarray: now supports -s|--status switch to query parity check status
    for given devices.
  * checkarray: now supports -x|--cancel switch to cancel running checks.
  * mkconf: now also outputs 'MAILADDR root' and 'HOMEHOST <system>'.
  * Added README.checkarray with some information about the check process.
  * Added /usr/share/doc/mdadm/FAQ to answer some FAQs.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Thu,  3 Aug 2006 22:54:04 +0100

mdadm (2.5.2-9) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added logcheck rules for kernel messages generated by checkarray, using
    logcheck server level.
  * Added handling of partitionable arrays to root RAID autodetection script
    (closes: #380596).
  * Forcing RAID assembly to run the arrays, working around an upstream bug
    until that's fixed (closes: #287415).
  * Updated documentation in README.initramfs-transition to include
    information related to #380089.
  * Updated debconf translations:
    - Vietnamese by Clytie Syddall, thanks!

mdadm (2.5.2-8) unstable; urgency=low

  * Re-added rootraiddoc.97.html which was mysteriously lost (closes: #378678).
  * Catching modprobe error in case of absence of the kernel modules, or
    a non-modular kernel. Thanks to Holger Levsen.
  * Copy raid456 kernel module into initramfs, if present (closes: #380152).
  * checkarray: check for presence of active RAID arrays and give an
    appropriate error if there are none present (closes: #379019).
  * checkarray: skip sync for non-redundant devices (closes: #379352, #380424).
  * Fixing cron registration for checkarray. crontab(5) is really stupid and
    makes me think that they simply documented a bug instead of fixing it, so
    now I have to hack around it. See the cron.d file (closes: #380425).
  * Removed the code writing auto-detected devices to /var, which was silly
    since /var isn't necessarily mounted yet by the time mdadm-raid is called.
    Thanks to Maurizio Avogadro for pointing this out.
  * Add reference to BAARF to README.Debian and included the RAID5 vs RAID10
    article from the BAARF website.
  * Updated debconf translations:
    - Japanese by Hideki Yamane, thanks!
    - French by Florentin Duneau, thanks! (closes: #379511)

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Thu, 27 Jul 2006 22:49:32 +0100

mdadm (2.5.2-7) unstable; urgency=low

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Thu, 20 Jul 2006 17:23:23 +0100

mdadm (2.5.2-6) experimental; urgency=low

  * Adding mdrun to generated udeb. I will only remove mdrun after etch.
  * Updated debconf translations:
    - Dutch, thanks to Frans "Franzerl" Pop! (closes: #377412)
    - French, thanks to Florentin Duneau! (closes: #377968)

mdadm (2.5.2-5) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Remove the check for the lvm prereq in the initramfs hook, as #369617 is
    now fixed. Thus conflicts against initramfs-tools (<< 0.65).
  * Updated debconf translations:
    - German, thanks to Mario Joußen!
  * Added short note about maintenance in SVN to README.Debian.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Thu, 13 Jul 2006 23:10:36 +0200

mdadm (2.5.2-4) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * The "it takes two to swing" release.
  * Now does not stop arrays on upgrade or remove. Thanks (and sorry) to
    Christian Pernegger (and hopefully no others).
  * Fixed small problem in debconf configuration script related to unbound
    MAIL_TO variable. Thanks to Christian Pernegger.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Fri,  7 Jul 2006 16:59:01 +0200

mdadm (2.5.2-3) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * The initramfs now gets all RAID modules installed. It's a lot safer to
    have them all around, the size difference is negligible, and we still only
    load the needed ones at boot time.
  * Added /usr/share/mdadm/checkarray, which can be used to check arrays for
    parity. Also added a debconf question to let the user choose whether
    cron should run these checks (closes: #377071).
  * Only shut down arrays automatically when they've been automatically
    started (closes: #376009).
  * Make sure the user has a chance to choose the autostart feature by
    elevating the debconf priority to high (see #376009). The warning about
    reuse of RAID components has also been elevated to debconf priority high.
  * The MAIL_TO setting from /etc/default/mdadm has been removed. Instead, use
    MAILADDR in /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf. See mdadm.conf(5). Your setting should
    be automatically migrated.
  * Now rewrites /etc/default/mdadm (but preserves settings) instead of trying
    to patch it with changes.
  * Added note to README.Debian to ensure users know that only the devices
    listed in mdadm.conf will be autostarted (see #376009).
  * Now includes latest md.txt from kernel documentation in
    /usr/share/doc/mdadm/md.txt.gz.
  * Added some more recipes to /usr/share/doc/mdadm/README.recipes.gz.
  * Updated debconf translations:
    - Swedish, thanks to Daniel Nylander!
    - Brazilian Portuguese, thanks to Felipe Augusto van de Wiel!
    - Czech, thanks to Miroslav Kure!
    - Russian, thanks to Yuri Kozlov (closes: #376181).
  * Further updates to the debconf templates; I hope the translators aren't
    going to kill me.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Fri,  7 Jul 2006 15:09:40 +0200

mdadm (2.5.2-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * The "if it weren't for Munich's wheat beer, there'd be no" release.
  * Removed -fno-strict-aliasing from compiler options, after upstream fixed
    the bug that led to its use (see #369779, #356153). Thanks to Elimar
    Riesebieter for pointing this out (closes: #375876).
  * Moved detection of RAID devices from initramfs hook to debconf control
    file, and added a (low-priority) debconf question as to which devices
    should be started early in the boot sequence. For the cases where we
    failed to auto-detect previously (e.g. root on LVM on RAID), it's paranoid
    and suggests to start them all (closes: #375879). Thanks to Alec Berryman
    for spotting this.
  * Fixed a typo in README.experimental, which could lead to an unbootable
    system with initramfs-tools 0.64 or before. Again, thanks to Alec for
    spotting this.
  * Extended bug script to include --examine output for all components (at
    least if called by root, which hopefully should never happen. Err,
    wait...)
  * Disabled deprecation warning in mdrun until the transition is complete.
  * Reworded the debconf templates due to a new question, and also for
    readability.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Thu, 29 Jun 2006 22:54:47 +0200

mdadm (2.5.2-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Implemented checks in the initramfs hooks and scripts for compatibility
    with initramfs-tools. Now we do not need a conflict anymore because
    mdadm's hooks and scripts will simply do nothing while the ones provided
    by initramfs-tools are still present.
  * Not using /bin/bash for mdrun, which I thought we'd need for read timeout
    support (for the deprecation warning). Since the -n and -t flags to the
    read shell builtin are non-POSIX, I dropped them, they were merely
    cosmetic anyway.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Tue, 27 Jun 2006 15:06:55 +0200

mdadm (2.5.1-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * Updating dependency on initramfs-tools, which has not yet adopted to mdadm
    taking over the hooks.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Jun 2006 22:35:08 +0200

mdadm (2.5.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release:
    - Really fixes return status of examine (closes: #367901).
    - Fixes a memory leak in monitor mode (closes: #372618).
    - Fixes compiler warnings and errors (closes: #373802, #356153, #369779).
    - Fix byte swapping issues (closes: #369765).
    - Now lists devices it stops (closes: #369850). This also leads to
      beautification of the init.d script's stop action.
  * Fixed RAID init script to not complain about missing logger command.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Jun 2006 00:58:36 +0200

mdadm (2.5-4) experimental; urgency=low

  * The "would you like fries with your parasite?" release.
  * Now does not require RAID support from the kernel just for package
    installation; that was silly of me, sorry (closes: Bug#370115).
  * Added version to Replaces: initramfs-tools dependency.
  * Further init.d script improvements.
  * Recommends mail-transport-agent, or the monitor daemon won't be able to
    send anything.
  * Ignores failures from modprobe in postinst when RAID modules are not
    available (closes: #370582).

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Tue,  6 Jun 2006 12:45:53 +0200

mdadm (2.5-3) experimental; urgency=low

  * Added /usr/share/doc/mdadm/README.recipes with some common usage examples.
  * Vastly improved the mdadm-raid init.d script output, and removed bashisms.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Fri,  2 Jun 2006 00:45:06 +0200

mdadm (2.5-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * The "on her majesty's secret service" release.
  * Enabled -DDEBIAN during build, which will take care of default permissions
    on devices created by mdadm. Together with the CREATE configuration
    directive in 2.5, this now certainly closes: Bug#310241.
  * Added a patch (incorporating lib/mm/xlate.h from lvm2) to prevent direct
    access to kernel headers from userspace (closes: Bug#369765).
  * Disabled strict aliasing compiler checks until we find a better
    implementation for linked lists in C (closes: Bug#369779, Bug#356153).
  * Actually decreased the size of the udeb mdadm binary with -Os
    -fomit-frame-pointer (as suggested by Joey Hess) (closes: Bug#314370)
  * Added Replaces: initramfs-tools to communicate that we're not conflicting
    but replacing instead (see Bug#367567)
  * Updated conflict with initramfs-tools to (<< 0.63) per suggestion by the
    maintainers.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Jun 2006 20:15:17 +0200

mdadm (2.5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * The "show me the way to the next whiskey bar" release.
  * See /usr/share/doc/mdadm/README.experimental or
    http://madduck.net/~madduck/scratch/README.experimental
  * New upstream release:
    - mails include /proc/mdstat output (closes: Bug#355882)
    - allows specification of device permissions in config (closes: Bug#310241)
  * /sbin/mdrun has been deprecated and replaced by calls to /sbin/mdadm;
    a proper deprecation warning is in place (see NEWS).
  * Moved initramfs hook and script into the package, and switched it to mdadm
    (from mdadm. Thanks to Stephen Frost for his help (closes: Bug#354144).
    This should make sure that the right minor numbers are chosen during boot
    (mainly because mdadm takes care of it all) (closes: Bug#361408).
  * Removing mdrun from the udeb (d-i patch submitted to debian-boot mailing
    list)
  * Upstream links against openssl for SHA1 support (homehost feature), which
    is a problem. An internal SHA1 implementation is provided, however, so
    I just link against that.
  * Switched init.d scripts to use LSB-compliant output.
  * Enhanced init.d script output.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Jun 2006 02:20:22 +0200

mdadm (2.4.1-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The "this took way longer than I thought" release.
  * Migrating to unstable.
  * If the init.d script creates the mdadm.conf file, it should remove it on
    purge. To accomplish this, I create a semaphore in /var/lib/mdadm if it
    was generated, and only remove the conffile on purge if the semaphore
    exists.
  * Added a little helper /usr/share/mdadm/mkconf to aid generation of
    configuration file.
  * Added a bug script to collect some important information when the user
    uses Debian bug reporting tools (such as reportbug).
  * Added a debian/watch file.

mdadm (2.4.1-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * The "I'll kill that maintainer... uh, wait, it's me" release. Sorry for
    the delay, here's the long awaited new upstream release (closes:
    Bug#337903, Bug#363592), which gets rid of a bunch of functionality bugs:
    - reiserfs size does not overflow anymore (closes: Bug#318230)
    - fixed typos in manpages (closes: Bug#352798)
    Oh, and we're moving away from that arch nightmare too. Sorry for the
    confusion.
  * Experimental release, because I really don't want to be responsible for
    data loss. Though I am quite sure that the upgrade is painless, I also
    don't have access to 18 drive RAID 10 with multipath on s390 or similar
    arrangements.
  * We now make the /dev/md* devices in postinst unless /dev/md15 exists (no
    longer checking for /dev/md0), or unless devfs is in use. If udev is used,
    /dev/md15 will only exist in complex setups, so the devices will be made
    in /dev/.static by MAKEDEV, which is not really a concern. I opted against
    unconditionally calling MAKEDEV until #367407 is fixed so as to preserve
    custom permissions or owner settings. This also acknowledges the NMU
    (#299623).
    closes: Bug#310247, Bug#299623
  * Patched some of the code to make mdadm honour /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf over
    /etc/mdadm.conf (see NEWS).
  * Fixed a couple of typos in the mdadm(8) manpage; thanks to Reuben Thomas.
    closes: Bug#345669, Bug#345667
  * Pushed Standards-Version to 3.7.2; no changes required.
  * Updated Debconf translations:
    - Vietnamese by Clytie Siddall (closes: Bug#323950)

mdadm (1.9.0-4.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * High-urgency upload for sarge-targetted RC bugfix
  * Make sure error output from MAKEDEV is sent to stderr, to avoid
    interfering with debconf; this avoids installation problems on
    udev-using systems.  Thanks to Jonas Smedegaard for the patch.
    Closes: #299623.

 -- Steve Langasek <vorlon@debian.org>  Wed,  1 Jun 2005 03:36:42 -0700

mdadm (1.9.0-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * High-urgency upload for sarge targeted RC bugfix.

    (closes: Bug#310671).

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Wed, 25 May 2005 09:51:41 +0200

mdadm (1.9.0-3) unstable; urgency=high

  * High-urgency upload for sarge targeted RC bugfix.
  * Applied patch by Peter Samuelson <peter@p12n.org>, which causes mdadm to
    follow symlinks of device nodes (closes: #274859, #310412, #310492).
  * Added myself as co-maintainer as per agreement with Mario Joussen.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Tue, 24 May 2005 00:03:49 +0200

mdadm (1.9.0-2.3) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Do not prevent postinst node creation when udev is being used; MAKEDEV
    puts files into /dev/.static/dev with udev, which is needed so that device
    nodes will be there even if udev is removed. Sorry for letting this slip
    my mind and thanks to Steve Langasek for spotting this error.
  * Leaving urgency at high to make sarge.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Sun, 22 May 2005 19:35:04 +0200

mdadm (1.9.0-2.2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * High-urgency upload for sarge targeted RC bugfix.
  * Move mdadm-raid back to S25 as it needs to run after modules have been
    loaded at S20 (see followups to #294404, #301560).
  * Verified that Steve Langasek's patch to config.c (see item 4 of the
    1.9.0-2.1 changelog) is necessary for `mdadm -A -s` to work.
    (closes: #301560)
  * Integrated patch by Erik van Konijnenburg to fix mdadm's --auto
    option in the presence of --scan.
    (closes: #294404, #273182, #284028, #310126).
  * Modified mdrun to call mdadm with --auto in assembly mode. Removed code
    which would auto-create 24 device nodes during system startup when udev
    was used.
  * Fixed next_free_md function in mdrun to iterate all 24 nodes instead of
    using some fragile shell globbing, which did not work anyway.
  * Prevent postinst node creation when udev is being used.
  * Added a README.udev file to /usr/share/doc/mdadm.

 -- martin f. krafft <madduck@debian.org>  Sun, 22 May 2005 12:57:56 +0200

mdadm (1.9.0-2.1) unstable; urgency=high

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * High-urgency upload for sarge targetted RC bugfix.
  * Start mdadm-raid before udev on boot-up, so that mdadm device node
    creation is honored, and support changing the init script ordering
    on upgrades (closes: #294404).
  * Fix mdadm --scan to prefer the values contained in /proc/partitions,
    instead of picking up device node names at random from /dev.
  * Teach mdrun to look at /dev/.static/dev instead of /.dev for udev
    mounts requiring autostart (closes: #301560).
