"If the kernel supports it (versions greater than 2.6.14), mdadm can "
"periodically check the redundancy of MD arrays (RAIDs). This may be a "
"resource-intensive process, depending on the local setup, but it could help "
"prevent rare cases of data loss. Note that this is a read-only check unless "
"errors are found; if errors are found, mdadm will try to correct them, which "
"may result in write access to the media."
