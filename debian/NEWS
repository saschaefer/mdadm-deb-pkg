mdadm (2.6.7-2) unstable; urgency=low

  /dev/disk symlinks:
    mdadm now creates symlinks in /dev/disk/by-id, using the template
    md-uuid-* for the array UUIDs and md-name-* for any names assigned to
    arrays (version-1 superblocks only). Thanks to Suse for the udev rules
    file.

  mdrun removed:
    This version also removes mdrun once and for all. If you are still using
    mdrun, please ensure that you have a valid /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf file (run
    /usr/share/mdadm/mkconf --generate to get one), and run

      mdadm --assemble --scan --auto=yes

    instead of mdrun. Or make use of /usr/share/mdadm/startall .

mdadm (2.5.3.git200608201206-1) unstable; urgency=low

  This version makes mdadm.conf mandatory. If you do not have such a file, it
  will be created for you.

  You must verify the contents of this file and ensure that it represents your
  local configuration. See /usr/share/doc/mdadm/README.upgrading-2.5.3.gz for
  more information.

mdadm (2.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  mdrun has been (finally) obsoleted, and an appropriate warning message is
  written to the console if you (or a script) attempts to run it. If you
  cannot live without mdrun, you can disable the warning by setting
  USE_DEPRECATED_MDRUN=1 in /etc/default/mdadm. Note that mdrun will *not* be
  supported. Please also see /usr/share/doc/mdadm/README.mdrun .

mdadm (2.4.1-5) unstable; urgency=low

  This version drops the automatic generation of the /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf
  file on every boot (if it was missing). This means that you need to ensure
  that you have a valid configuration file. If none is present during package
  configuration, mdadm *will* try to generate one, but it will only contain
  information about arrays that were running at the time of package
  configuration. Arrays not listed in the configuration file will *not* be
  started automatically after boot (with the exception of the root partition).

  If you want to recreate your configuration file, either figure out what it
  should contain from the mdadm.conf(5) manpage, or simply assemble and run
  all the arrays the way you like it, then run
    /usr/share/mdadm/mkconf force-generate /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf

mdadm (2.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  As of version 2.3, mdadm uses /etc/mdadm.conf as its main configuration
  file, and falls back to /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf if the former is not found.
  Since Debian uses /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf as the configuration file path, this
  order was reverted: Debian's mdadm reads /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf as its main
  file and falls back to /etc/mdadm.conf if the former is not found.

  An incompatible change in the reshaping of RAID 5 arrays was made in this
  upstream release. If you want to reshape a RAID 5 array with a version-1
  superblock, please make sure to use mdadm 2.4.1 and at least a 2.6.17-rc2
  kernel.
