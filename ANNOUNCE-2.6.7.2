Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 2.6.7.2 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux

I am pleased to announce the availability of
   mdadm version 2.6.7.2

It is available at the usual places:
   countrycode=xx.
   http://www.${countrycode}kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/
and via git at
   git://neil.brown.name/mdadm
   http://neil.brown.name/git?p=mdadm

mdadm is a tool for creating, managing and monitoring
device arrays using the "md" driver in Linux, also
known as Software RAID arrays.

Release 2.6.7.2 fixes one bug in 2.6.7.1 and is a special release
for Debian Lenny (which is too frozen to take 2.6.8).

-   Fix an error when assembling arrays that are in the middle of a reshape.

Development of mdadm is sponsored by
 SUSE Labs, Novell Inc.
