mdadm is a tool for creating, managing and monitoring
device arrays using the "md" driver in Linux, also
known as Software RAID arrays.

Release 2.6.7.1 fixes two bugs in 2.6.7 and is a special release
for Debian Lenny (which is too frozen to take 2.6.8).

Changelog Entries:
    -   Manage: allow adding device that is just large enough to v1.x array.

Development of mdadm is sponsored by
 SUSE Labs, Novell Inc.
