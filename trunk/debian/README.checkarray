checkarray notes
================

checkarray will run parity checks across all your redundant arrays. By
default, it is configured to run on the first Sunday of each month, at 01:06
in the morning. This is realised by asking cron to wake up every Sunday with
/etc/cron.d/mdadm, but then only running the script when the day of the month
is less than or equal to 7. See #380425.

'check' is a read-only operation, even though the kernel logs may suggest
otherwise (e.g. /proc/mdstat and several kernel messages will mention
"resync"). Please also see question 21 of the FAQ.

If, however, while reading, a read error occurs, the check will trigger the
normal response to read errors which is to generate the 'correct' data and try
to write that out - so it is possible that a 'check' will trigger a write.
However in the absence of read errors it is read-only.

You can cancel a running array check with the -x option to checkarray.
