Subject:  ANNOUNCE: mdadm 2.6.8 - A tool for managing Soft RAID under Linux

I am pleased to announce the availability of
   mdadm version 2.6.8

It is available at the usual places:
   countrycode=xx.
   http://www.${countrycode}kernel.org/pub/linux/utils/raid/mdadm/
and via git at
   git://neil.brown.name/mdadm
   http://neil.brown.name/git?p=mdadm

mdadm is a tool for creating, managing and monitoring
device arrays using the "md" driver in Linux, also
known as Software RAID arrays.

Release 2.6.8 contains various bug fixes and minor enhancements.
It is possibly that 2.6.8 will be the last release in the 2.x
series and very likely that there will never be a 2.7.
Hopefully 3.0 will be released soon making future development
of 2.6.x unnecessary.  However if a need does arise for a 2.6.9
it will be considered.
